# Mint a Friend
## Simple random NFT minter
A simple NFT minting app that mints a random NFT out of a list of possible assets

## Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ and [web3.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) v1.7.5+
to run.

Clone into folder and then : 

```sh
npm i
```
You need to have a .env file in your root folder with the following : 

```sh
API_KEY = "YOUR_THENTIC_API_KEY"
CONTRACT = "CONTRACT_YOU_ARE_MINTING_ON"
RAPID_API_KEY = "YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY"
```

Runs on Rinkeby testnet, so you need to have some test ether in your wallet. 


Enjoy!
